            As I mentioned on my home page I love to bake. Ever since I was a little girl it was always 
            something that I found joy in. My favorite times of the year are the holiday seasons, that 
            way I have the perfect excuse to bake. When I was a little girl and had a lot of time and 
            energy I would be baking away for hours. One of my favorite things I would make was cake pops. 
            Pictured above is me as a little girl making my holiday-themed cake pops. And although it was 
            a lot of work and I did not receive much help from my familial members I was always very happy 
            and excited to make my treats as I knew they were delicious and would make my family happy. 
            Nowadays it is a little harder for me to find time to bake, but most recently for a dinner party 
            with my friends, I had the perfect excuse to show off my baking skills and impress my friends with 
            a delicious dessert. Pictured above is my yummy chocolate olive oil cake with a whipped cream cardamom 
            frosting and garnished with some crushed pistachios. Everyone loved it and there was not a single slice 
            left by the end of the night.
