        Hi, I'm Giastina! I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Business Administration, 
        concentrating in Marketing Analytics at Northeastern University. I am graduating this spring and am taking my 
        final two classes in the Summer 1 session. I am planning on applying to get my master's in Data analytics after 
        graduation and hopefully spend a few more years in Boston, which I have grown to love. I am originally from 
        Westchester New York (about 30 minutes away from New York City) and hopefully, after my studies, I will be able 
        to move back closer to home with my family. I have 3 adorable dogs that I love dearly (one pictured above named Luna) 
        and I also have a pet chinchilla ðŸ˜€. One of them is a Shiba Inu named Max and the other two are Pomeranians named Luna 
        and Teddy.  On top of my studies, I am a hostess at a restaurant in the Backbay area called Parm, making me quite busy 
        and having limited free time. However, when I do have the occasional free time some things I love to do include reading, 
        thrifting, exploring the Boston area and my absolute favorite thing to do is bake. To learn more about my baking click 
        the about tab ðŸ˜‰.
